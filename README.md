# Genome Database
Program for researchers to input large amounts of genomic data from multiple files into an SQLite database for future retrieval.

The files used to generate the database are not included in this repo, as I do not have permission to share them. To give a general overview of a complete database's layout, see the following images.

## Sample database
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
